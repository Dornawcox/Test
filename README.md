# Agricultural Knowledge Concordance — GitHub Pages (Webflow-style draft)

This folder contains a single `index.html` plus `assets/` images.
Upload to a GitHub repo root and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages).

Notes:
- External CSS/JS are referenced from a Webflow-hosted stylesheet and scripts.
- Replace placeholder links (e.g., support/nominations) as they become available.
